* Mouse brain (splenium)
* 0.00236 micrometer pixel size
* FOV = 8.88x5.39 micrometer squared
* Tissue preparation: 2% paraformaldehyde - 2.5% glutaraldehyde

* Our original paper (Aldo et al. 2018), the FOV was reported to be 6x9 um^2. This is because 1) these original values were reported in the original data reference (below), and 2) our images here are slightly cropped at the bottom relative to the original data in order to remove the scale bar.
* Our original paper (Aldo et al. 2018) reported the resolution as being 0.002 micrometer, which was (for an unknown reason) rounded in the paper from the true value of 0.00236 micrometer, as reported in the original data reference (below).
